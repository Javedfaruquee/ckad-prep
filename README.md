Some Tip:

The CKAD certification is an open book exam(you get access to kubernetes.io & its subdomain). And all question would have their answeres somehwere in the site however the KEY is to manage the time and clear as many questions as possible. 

# The key is accuracy with speed. 

You can not afford to learn the concept during the exam. You need actual hands-on otherwise it would be difficult.
